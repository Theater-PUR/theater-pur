## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for dependency installation
- Node.js 22.23.4 or newer in the 22.x release line (`nvm use`)
- [Sanity account](https://www.sanity.io/) and project
- [Fienta account](https://fienta.com/) (optional, for ticket integration)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd homepage-2026
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION=2024-01-01
   SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
   ```

4. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```

   The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

5. **Access Sanity Studio:**

   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/studio](http://localhost:3000/studio) to manage content

## 📝 Content Management

### Sanity Studio

The Sanity Studio is integrated directly into the Next.js application at `/studio`. Content editors can manage:

- **Theaterstücke (Plays)** - Productions with cast, performances, galleries, and pricing
- **Neuigkeiten (News)** - Blog posts and announcements
- **Seiteneinstellungen (Site Settings)** - Global site configuration including:
  - Hero section content
  - Navigation and footer
  - Contact information
  - Social media links
  - Current play reference
  - Fienta organizer ID

### Content Types

#### Play (Theaterstück)

- Title, author, director, year
- Cover image and gallery
- Description and detailed synopsis
- Cast members
- Performance schedule (can be synced from Fienta)
- Ticket pricing
- Active/archive status

#### News Post (Neuigkeit)

- Title, slug, cover image
- Excerpt and full content (rich text)
- Categories (Backstage, Ankündigung, Aufführung, etc.)
- Publication date

#### Site Settings

Centralized configuration for all site-wide content and settings

## 🎟️ Fienta Integration

The website integrates with [Fienta.com](https://fienta.com/) to fetch event data and enable ticket sales.

### Setup

1. Add your Fienta Organizer ID to Site Settings in Sanity Studio
2. Performances matching the play title will be automatically fetched
3. Ticket booking links will be displayed on the current play page

### How it Works

- The `lib/fienta.ts` module handles API communication
- Events are fetched by organizer ID and filtered by play title
- Performance data is transformed into the site's format
- Booking URLs link directly to Fienta checkout

## 🎨 Customization

### Theme

The site uses a dark theater theme with Tailwind CSS. Customize colors and styling in:

- `app/globals.css` - CSS variables and custom styles
- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind configuration (if needed)

### Components

UI components are built with shadcn/ui and can be customized:

```bash
# Add new components
bunx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
```

## 🚢 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
2. Import the project in [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
   - `package.json` selects the managed Node.js 22 runtime. The build and Node.js function startup check the security minimum version.
3. Add environment variables
4. Deploy!

### Environment Variables for Production

Ensure these are set in your deployment platform:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION`
- `SANITY_API_TOKEN` (for ISR and draft mode)

bun dev          # Start dev server

# Production
bun build        # Build for production
bun start        # Start production server
